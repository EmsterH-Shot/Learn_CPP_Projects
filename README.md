# Learn C++ Projects

All completed projects from Codecademy's Learn C++ course.

*This repository is currently a work-in-progress. As of Early September 2025, I still have a few more projects to upload, mainly the larger, multi-file ones later in the course. Those will be uploaded soon!*

## Overview

This is a collection of all of the projects I completed in Codecademy's Learn C++ course. I originally took and completed this course in 2023, but I did not realize the importance of having an online programming portfolio at the time. Now that I'm pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I recognize how crucial a portfolio is and am now uploading these projects, which I had thankfully saved in a Google Doc for later access before cancelling my Codecademy Pro subscription. (It was unclear to me if I would still have access to my completed coursework.)

## Dependencies/Installation Requirements

All of these .cpp files are meant to be run in the terminal, and you will need to have a C++ compiler such as g++, clang++, or MSVC in order to compile and run the code in your own terminal.

## Compiling and Running the Code

To run any of these files, first clone the repository as follows in your terminal:

### Cloning the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/EmsterH-Shot/Learn_CPP_Projects.git```

### Navigating to the folder location:
```cd path/to/folder/with/cpp/files```

### Compiling the desired file:
```g++ -o program_name file_name.cpp```

Replace program_name with what you wish to name the compiled program.
Replace file_name.cpp with the actual name of the file you wish to compile.

### Running the compiled file on Windows:
```program_name.exe```

### Running the compiled file on Mac or Linux:
```./program_name```
